Boundary Frequency:
Clear visibility of how often boundaries (4s and 6s) occur compared to singles and dots (0s).

Sparse High Scores:
Runs like 5 and 6 are rare, showing their exceptional nature in an IPL game.

Visual Representation:
Use of color-coded dots and grid lines improves readability and presentation of scoring pattern data.
